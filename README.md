# ERA1-Session5
## Session 5 Assignment of ERA 1 program from  TSAI "The School of AI"

### About this Assignment

To create a simple CNN based model using pytorch framework. Intention here is to make the code modular.
Model is included in model.py and utility functions are included in utils.py, these modules are imported in main S5.ipynb file.

Dataset = MNIST
Batch size = 512
No of parameters in model = 593, 200
Number of epoch = 20
Test Accuracy = 99.6 %

### Framework and main libraries used

### Organization - Modular Files

### Model Parameters

### Accuracy of the model

### Future improvements
